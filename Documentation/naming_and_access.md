# Naming and Access Conventions

## Git Branches

Git branches should be named in kebab-case (e.g., `crouch-fix`).

This appears to be common practice and is consistent with the default branch `master`.

Before creating a branch, use `git branch` to list existing branches to make sure it doesn't already exist. If it does, come up with a different name or add a
number at the end (e.g., `crouch-fix-2`).

You may see older branches that do not follow this convention. Avoid creating a branch that differs from an existing one only in case.

## Scenes

Scenes should be named in PascalCase. This is consistent with the default scene `SampleScene`.
