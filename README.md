Game 2 of the Quoke project, teaching people to prepare for the Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake.

This repository, containing code for an NSF-funded project, is public. Paid assets from the Unity Asset Store are *not* included in the repository.

You must currently use *exactly* Unity 2020.3.28f1. If this isn't available directly through UnityHub, you can go to the [Unity Archive Page](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive) and download it through UnityHub there.

To open this project in Unity:

1. Clone the repository as usual but *do not open it in Unity yet*. If you do, Unity will build improper internal links to the missing assets.
2. Download [Purchased.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1itwDc-w_W27xyFXoAA1W4IkfBD4I1e_3/view?usp=sharing) and put it in the `Assets` directory. This file is only accessible to members of our team, because we do not have the right to redistribute these assets.
3. Unzip it to create a `Purchased` directory within `Assets`.
4. Open the project in Unity.

The playable game will be made available after experiments using it have been completed.
