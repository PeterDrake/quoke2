Game 2 of the Quoke project, teaching people to prepare for the Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake.

This repository, containing code for an NSF-funded project, is public. Paid assets from the Unity Asset Store are *not* included in the repository.

You must currently use *exactly* Unity 2020.3.9f1. If this isn't available directly through UnityHub, you can go to the [Unity Archive Page](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive) and download it through UnityHub there.

To open this project in Unity:

1. Clone the repository as usual but *do not open it in Unity yet*. If you do, Unity will build improper internal links to the missing assets.
2. Within the `Assets` directory, create a directory called `Purchased`.
3. Obtain the following assets and copy them into `Purchased`:
    - DogPack
    - hospital assets
    - PolygonApocalypse
    - POLYGONCityCharacters
    - PolygonCity
    - PolygonTown
    - SampleScenes
    - SimpleApocalypse
    - SimpleApocalypseInteriors
    - SimpleInteriorsHouses
    - SimpleItems
    - SimpleOfficeInteriors
    - SimplePort
    - SimpleShopInteriors
    - Standard Assets
4. Open the project in Unity.

The playable game will be made available after experiments using it have been completed.
